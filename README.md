This game was created during the time spent at HackNC on November 5th through November 6th at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. It is a game simulating the falling of a Pterodactyl from its nest. As the Pterodactyl falls and "Learns to Fly" it has to avoid many branches as it falls infintely getting better at flying as its speed increases with gravity.
